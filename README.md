# argos-checker
A simple app to check an item stock on Argos across all the stores

## Motivation
I was tired to have to change the dropdown to check if a product was available on the other 

## Run
```sh
mvn install
```

```sh
java -jar target/argos-checker.jar <product-code>
```

where <product-code> is something like that: 865/7565
